## Real Feature Gaps (Things iOS Genuinely Doesn't Have)

After the audit, the actual list of iOS-missing features is:

**High value (Batch A — Week 2):**
1. Duel (`/duel`) — entire feature missing
2. Learn hub (`/learn`) + Learn → Ninny + Learn → Paths
3. Classes index page
4. Arena PvP matchmaking ("Find Match" → real matches)
5. Mastery orchestrator full integration

**Medium value (Batch B — Week 3):**
6. Syllabus upload
7. Grade tracker
8. Flashcard study (standalone)
9. Study DNA
10. Shop cosmetics + boosters (UI exists, stubbed)
11. Friend DM

**Low value (Batch D — Week 4 or defer):**
12. Games hub
13. Focus music toggle

## Reverse Parity — Things iOS has that Web Should Match

These are flagged for the WEB team — iOS shipped them first or better:
- **Notifications inbox** — iOS has full `/notifications` route; web has component only
- **Daily Bet** — verify web has it
- **Bounties card** — verify web has it
- **Streak Revive UI** — iOS has dedicated banner + hook
- **Native auth flow polish** — Apple auth, haptics, animated intro on iOS

---

## How to Use This File

**When shipping a NEW feature:**
1. Add a row in the relevant section with `Web: ✅` and `iOS: ❌ port pending`.
2. Mention in CHANGELOG that iOS parity is tracked here.

**When porting to iOS:**
1. Flip the iOS column from `❌` to `✅` (or `🟡` if partial).
2. Note the iOS route path or component path.

**Audit cadence:** Quarterly full audit by `Explore` agent + `quality-docs-writer`.

*Strategy = shared-core extraction (Strategy C) starting Week 1. Once core lands, parity-by-default becomes the default workflow — no more drift.*
