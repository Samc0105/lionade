## 2026-05-25
- perf(web): **SWR cache + tab-switch refetch fix — Phase B (web only, local commit, not yet pushed).** Builds on Phase A by formalising the cache-key registry as the shared cross-platform source-of-truth, and consuming the new `@lionade/core/cache/storage` factory + `StorageAdapter` interface that `ios-shared-core` shipped earlier the same day. Both web and iOS now run on the SAME `createPersistedSwrProvider` scaffold; only the platform-specific I/O adapter differs.
  - **Hook migration to shared `cacheKeys` registry** — `lib/hooks.ts`: `useUserStats` + `mutateUserStats` now consume `cacheKeys.userStats(userId)` from `@lionade/core/cache/keys` instead of inline template strings. Same string output (`user-stats/${userId}`) so no cache invalidation; sourced from the canonical helper so any future shape change is a one-line edit in the shared package, mirrored on iOS automatically. Hook count migrated this pass: **1** (useUserStats) — the only hook whose inline key matched a registry helper string exactly. Remaining 26 useSWR sites have key drift vs registry (different naming, missing limit/lifetime params, dashboard-page-local hydrators) — each one documented in `packages/lionade-core/PHASE_B_NOTES.md §2` with a proposed registry extension for `ios-shared-core` to ship. Web migrates the moment each helper exists.
  - **Shared persistence factory consumed** — `lib/swr-config.ts` no longer reimplements hydrate/persist/debounce/LRU; it calls `createPersistedSwrProvider(adapter, opts)` from `@lionade/core/cache/storage`. The shared factory returns `{ cache, readyPromise, flush }`; web ignores `readyPromise` (localStorage is sync so cache is populated on first microtask) while iOS gates `SplashScreen.hideAsync()` on it. `flush()` is wired to the existing visibilitychange + beforeunload listeners. Net diff: `swr-config.ts` shrunk from 137 LOC to 134 LOC but with ALL the persistence semantics now shared cross-platform.
  - **Web localStorage adapter** — new file `lib/cache/localStorageAdapter.ts` (~100 LOC, web-internal, NOT in shared package). Pure I/O surface: 4 promise-typed methods wrapping `window.localStorage` with SSR guards + quota-swallow. Also exposes `stripSkippedKeys()` which `swr-config.ts` applies to the persisted JSON blob right before write.
  - **Persist-skip list** — explicit list of SWR key prefixes that stay in-memory only (no localStorage round-trip). Skipped: `leaderboard-*` (200-row payloads, revalidate every 30s anyway), `social-feed/*` (large feed blobs), `dashboard-weekly-chart/*` (rich UI-state-coupled chart), `mastery-session/*` (session-bound, short-lived). In-memory SWR cache still holds them for the page lifecycle. Applied at the adapter boundary (`withSkipList` wrapper in `swr-config.ts`) so the policy stays platform-local — the shared factory has no concept of skip lists by design, leaving iOS free to define its own (or none).
  - **Cross-platform coordination doc** — `packages/lionade-core/PHASE_B_NOTES.md` updated by admin (web) after consuming the iOS-shipped interface: 9 specific key-drift items needing shared `cacheKeys` helpers, persist-skip-list reasoning, sign-out cache-clear open question (`lib/auth.tsx` is "Do Not Touch" — CEO sign-off required to wire), versioning protocol. Web does NOT edit shared-package source — admin consumes, iOS team owns.
  - **iOS shared interface arrival:** `ios-shared-core` shipped `@lionade/core/cache/storage.ts` (interface + factory) the same day, in parallel with web's adapter work. Web pivoted from a local interface mirror to the canonical import as soon as the file landed — zero waste, clean consume.
  - **Quality gates:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (0 errors). `npm run core:typecheck` clean. `quality-qa-tester` walked happy path + 5 edge cases (cold load empty localStorage, cold load full localStorage, tab-switch warm load, signed-out → signed-in transition, localStorage quota error) — all pass. `quality-code-reviewer` clean — no "Do Not Touch" files modified, `keepPreviousData` preserved globally, Phase A `revalidateOnFocus` keep-list untouched. `dev-performance` confirmed: skip-list reduces visibilitychange persist payload by ~20–30% (rough estimate from typical leaderboard + feed sizes); no new network calls; bundle delta negligible — the factory module is small + tree-shaken into the same chunk as `swr-config.ts`.
  - **Status:** local commit only — **NOT yet pushed**. Sam reviews before push.

- perf(web): **SWR cache + tab-switch refetch fix — Phase A (web only, local commit, not yet pushed).** Surgical 5-change pass that eliminates the per-tab-switch revalidation storm against Supabase / `/api/*`. Audit found tab-switching between Dashboard ↔ Shop ↔ Compete ↔ Academia was firing a full revalidation cascade on every focus event (every page) plus a `POST /api/bounties/rotate` on every dashboard mount. After this pass: tab-switches read from cache (no network), per-hook overrides preserve the freshness-sensitive surfaces.
  - **Global SWR defaults flipped** — `lib/swr-config.ts`: `revalidateOnFocus: true → false`, `dedupingInterval: 5_000 → 60_000`. `keepPreviousData: true` retained so background revalidations never flash a skeleton. Hooks that materially need cross-tab freshness keep their per-hook `revalidateOnFocus: true` override (Navbar notifications, `useUserStats` Fangs balance, Social unread badges, ClockIn, StreakRevive, DailySpin, useStreakInfo, usePlan, useEloLeaderboard via dedupe, and ~20 page-level hooks that explicitly opt in — verified, all kept).
  - **Shop inventory raw `useEffect` → SWR** — `app/shop/page.tsx`: `loadInventory()` `useEffect` replaced with `useSWR("shop-inventory/" + user.id, ...)` (60s dedupe, keepPreviousData). `handlePurchase` + `handleEquip` now call `mutateInventory()` from the same key so equip/purchase still feels instant via post-mutation revalidate. Dropped unused `useCallback` import.
  - **Compete leaderboard raw `useEffect` → shared hook** — `app/compete/page.tsx`: replaced `useState + useEffect(getEloLeaderboard(5))` with `useEloLeaderboard(5)` (the existing `lib/hooks.ts` hook, 30s dedupe + shared cache with `/leaderboard` page). Removed dead `useState`/`useEffect` React imports.
  - **`/api/notifications` poll deduped between Navbar + Social** — `components/Navbar.tsx` + `app/social/page.tsx`: previously each page polled the endpoint on its own SWR key (`social-notifs/${uid}` on Social, raw `setInterval` on Navbar) → endpoint was hit twice every 15s when both were mounted. Both now keyed on `notifications/${user.id}` — single cache, single 15s poll, single realtime INSERT channel (Navbar's) invalidates the shared key so Social updates instantly. Navbar's optimistic local-state setters (mark-all-read) preserved by hydrating from SWR `onSuccess`.
  - **Dashboard bounty-rotation no longer auto-fires on every mount** — `app/dashboard/page.tsx`: `useEffect → POST /api/bounties/rotate` gated by `localStorage["bounties-last-rotation"]` 1h timestamp. Server still owns canonical rotation cadence; this is a client-side coalesce. (Long-term: move to Supabase cron — tracked separately.)
  - **Quality gates:** type-check passes (0 errors). `quality-qa-tester` signed off on tab-switch happy path + 4 edge cases (Fangs after purchase, Shop inventory after equip, Navbar/Social cache share, stale class list, stale Fangs after Daily Spin). `quality-code-reviewer` clean. Lint not run (no ESLint config wired; Next would scaffold interactively — skipped to avoid touching project config without Sam's consent — flagged for follow-up).
  - **Phase A retrofit — stripped redundant per-hook `revalidateOnFocus: true` overrides** (local commit, not yet pushed). The initial Phase A flipped the global default to `false` but left ~24 explicit per-hook `revalidateOnFocus: true` overrides untouched, so the global change was a no-op on those sites. This retrofit audited all 24 against Sam's confirmed keep-list (`useUserStats`, `useStreakInfo`, `usePlan`, Navbar+Social notifications, live mastery session) and stripped the override from 17 sites, keeping it on 7. Strips: `app/study-dna/page.tsx`, `app/classes/page.tsx`, `app/learn/mastery/page.tsx`, `app/learn/ninny/page.tsx`, `app/classes/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/academia/page.tsx` (×2), `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (YourClassesRow), `components/DailyDrillWidget.tsx`, `components/DailyReadyNudge.tsx`, `components/Class/SyllabusUpload.tsx`, `components/Class/GradeTracker.tsx`, `components/Class/ClassStreakChip.tsx`, `components/Class/FlashcardStudy.tsx`, plus 3 **borderline strips flagged for human review**: `components/ClockInButton.tsx`, `components/StreakReviveBanner.tsx`, `components/Shop/DailySpinHero.tsx` (all three still have `refreshInterval: 60_000` so freshness is preserved at minute granularity; Phase A swr-config comment had named them as keepers, but the confirmed keep-list did not). Type-check clean, QA re-validated, code review clean.
  - **Out of scope for Phase A (intentionally):** Dashboard RSC promotion (Phase D), `lib/db.ts:614 getSubjectStats` rewrite (Phase C), `@lionade/core` extraction (Phase B). No file in those scopes was touched.
  - **iOS impact:** iOS team is running an equivalent Phase A in parallel (different libraries — `useSWR` shape on iOS already exemplary per 2026-05-13 audit; iOS work targets its own focus-revalidate cadence). Cross-platform parity row added to `IOS_PARITY.md` covering "both platforms staged, awaiting user greenlight to push/build."
  - **Status:** local commit only — **NOT yet pushed**. Sam reviews staged commits before push.

## 2026-05-24
- feat(web): **Post-launch UX polish batch (5 changes).** Shipped immediately after the public launch / coming-soon retirement.
  - **Sign in with Apple on /login** — added `handleAppleAuth` (`supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: "apple" })`), mirroring the existing Google handler. New black-on-white-Apple-logo button appears in both Login and Sign Up Step 1 tabs, directly under "Continue with Google". Assumes Supabase Apple OAuth provider is already configured (iOS uses it via `~/Desktop/lionade-ios/lib/auth-oauth.ts` `signInWithApple`). Web now at iOS parity for OAuth providers. `app/login/page.tsx`.
  - **Subjects CTA → Coming Soon on /learn** — the `<Link href="/learn/paths">Subjects</Link>` 3-column secondary card is now a `<button>` that triggers a fixed-position auto-dismissing toast ("Subjects & Learning Paths — in development, coming soon") with a 3000ms `setTimeout`. Added a "Coming Soon" gold pill inside the card so the state is visible pre-click. Daily Quiz + Study with Ninny + Mastery Mode CTAs unchanged. `app/learn/page.tsx` (new `useState` + `useEffect` for `showSubjectsComingSoon`).
  - **Social ADD FRIEND moved to top-right UserPlus popover** — removed the always-visible ADD FRIEND search section AND the Sent Requests list from the left sidebar. Both now live inside a new modal triggered by a gold `UserPlus` icon button placed in the friends-search header row. Modal contents: search input with `MagnifyingGlass` icon + autocomplete dropdown (reusing existing handlers), Sent Requests list with "Undo" buttons (renamed from "Cancel" + added X icon prefix), empty-state ("No pending requests · Search above to add a friend"). Click-outside + X to dismiss with state reset. `app/social/page.tsx` (~84 lines removed from sidebar, ~150 added to modal).
  - **Claim toast 5s → 3s** — `components/ClockInButton.tsx`: `AUTO_CLOSE_MS = 5000` → `3000`. The "+X Fangs claimed" reveal toast auto-dismisses faster, matching the broader "respect the user's attention" pattern.
  - **Claim button single-click claim** — `components/ClockInButton.tsx`: when the daily button is in the available-to-claim state, clicking it now claims **instantly without auto-opening** the history popover. The previous behavior was `claim() AND setOpen(o => !o)` unconditionally — the popover open was a friction step the user didn't want. Cooldown/claimed state still opens the popover on click (so the user can see the countdown + history). `aria-label` updated to reflect the conditional behavior.
  - **iOS impact:** Apple sign-in is parity-with-iOS (iOS already had it 2026-05-21); Social ADD FRIEND popover is a web-specific layout choice (iOS social UI uses native modals); the Subjects Coming Soon block is web-only because iOS Learning Paths shipped 2026-05-13 with seed data already. Recorded in `IOS_PARITY.md`.

- feat(web-launch): **Public launch — coming-soon page retired.** `app/page.tsx` (the marketing landing) is no longer framed as a private-beta gate.
  - **Removed** the "Coming Soon — 2026" navbar badge; replaced with a `Sign In` link to `/login`.
  - **Removed** the hero email "Join the waitlist — be first in line" form and the Big-CTA "Drop your email, get early access" form. Both replaced with a single primary CTA button: **START STUDYING FREE** → `/login`.
  - **Demoted** waitlist to a single small `Get product updates` newsletter form just above the footer (still posts to `/api/waitlist`, source tag changed `landing` → `landing-newsletter`).
  - **Removed** the hidden 5-click DevOps secret trigger + admin-password modal that gated access to `/home`.
  - **Deleted** `app/api/beta-gate/route.ts` entirely. The `BETA_GATE_PASSWORD` env var in Vercel is now unused and can be removed (it's the only consumer).
  - **Updated** ROADMAP: collapsed "Q1 2026 Private Beta" into "Live Now — V1 Public Launch" (status `active`); V2 (Dec 2026) and V3 (Mar 2027) entries unchanged.
  - **Updated** FAQ #9 from "When does the public version launch?" → "Is Lionade live yet?" — answer rewritten to reflect live status.
  - **Cleaned up** unused state (`modalOpen`, `pw`, `error`, `success`, `email1/2`, `status1/2`, `msg1/2`), refs (`clickCountRef`, `resetTimerRef`, `inputRef`), and handlers (`handleSecretClick`, `closeModal`, `handleDevOpsSubmit`, two-arg `submitWaitlist`). Replaced with a single `newsletterEmail/Status/Msg` triple and a `submitNewsletter` handler. Removed `useRef` from the React import.
  - **File diff:** `app/page.tsx` 789 → 747 lines (function renamed `ComingSoonPage` → `LandingPage`).
  - **iOS impact:** none. iOS never had a coming-soon gate; the App Store IS the iOS launch gate. Recorded in `IOS_PARITY.md` (updated the Landing page row).
  - **Follow-up fix:** `app/home/page.tsx` deleted (and its directory). It was a 223-line `ProductLandingPage` only reachable via the deleted DevOps modal's "ENTER BETA" button. Its gate (`localStorage.getItem("lionade_beta_access") === "true"`) became unreachable when the modal that set that key was removed — so signed-out visitors hitting `/home` directly would have been redirect-looped to `/`. Caught by `quality-code-reviewer` in post-merge audit. **Known follow-up:** `components/Navbar.tsx` still has `isLanding = pathname === "/home"` (always evaluates to false now — dead conditional; harmless but worth cleaning up in a follow-up commit) and `isComingSoon = pathname === "/"` which is now a misnomer (the path is the public landing — rename to `isPublicLanding`). Not blockers.

## 2026-05-22
- feat(ios-ui): iOS "build 13" panel polish v3 + bottom-tab pill centering + Learn-tab web-parity close-out + Compete-tab layout fix and restructure + Daily Bet moved back to Dashboard + leaderboard button with top-20-with-anchor. Shipped to TestFlight 2026-05-23. iOS-only (Expo/React Native); no web code changed — Daily Bet relocation restores web parity (web doesn't host it on Compete) and the Learn tab gaps closed in this build are all preexisting web behaviours. Recorded in `IOS_PARITY.md`.
  - **iOS (profile side-panel polish v3):** the Go-Pro pill marquee now loops **truly seamlessly** — a 7-stop palette with GOLD anchors at positions 0 / 0.5 / 1.0 so the gradient is byte-identical at the loop boundary and the visible "refresh" is gone. **Go-Pro and PRO-MEMBER pills restructured into a two-layer construct** (outer paints the shadow, inner clips with `overflow: hidden` + `borderRadius: 999`) — the iOS pattern that finally fixes the "colors going outside" bleed. Pills are now `maxWidth: 300` centered with reduced shadow opacities so the purple glow no longer reads as a color leak.
  - **iOS (bottom tab limelight — vertical centering):** active pill `top: 3` so it sits vertically centered in the 70pt bar (was riding 6pt above the cell). Orphan `edgeOffset` shared value cleaned up.
  - **iOS (Learn tab — last web-parity gaps closed):** primary CTA now **deep-links to weakest subject** (`/quiz?subject=…`); mastery rows route per-subject. The 7-day **heatmap gained a legend** (less → 5 gold swatches → more) under the grid, and today's cell got a **gold glow**. The Level stat chip now displays the **lowercase tier name** below the number. The RECENT section header gained a tappable **`new →`** link that starts a fresh quiz.
  - **fix(ios): Compete tab layout** — the `BlurView` wrapper in `GroupedList` was collapsing intrinsic widths on iOS, making `ModeRow` chevrons appear to wrap below; **replaced with a plain matte `View` fill**. `ModeRow` labels now use the safe `Inter` font (not the registered-but-broken `Inter-Medium`); the chevron is the last sibling after the `flex:1` label View; rows have a uniform `minHeight: 56`.
  - **iOS (Daily Bet — moved back to Dashboard):** restores web parity — the web product doesn't have Daily Bet on Compete. The card now sits inside the Today section between Bounties and the Progress label, returning to its pre-2026-05-13 home.
  - **iOS (Compete leaderboard — button + top-20-with-anchor):** the embedded **Top Players mini-leaderboard removed from Compete**; a single **"Leaderboard" row added at the bottom of the Modes group** that routes to `/leaderboard`. The leaderboard screen now renders the **top 20** (podium 1–3 + list 4–20) and, if the viewer is outside top 20, **anchors their rank at the bottom in a gold-tinted highlight** (covers ranks 21–60 from the fetched entries, with a fallback to absolute rank + profile stats if outside top 60). `useLeaderboard` hook bumped from top-50 → top-60 fetch and now exposes `userRank: number | null`.
- feat(ios-ui): iOS "build 12" bottom-tab restructure to web-nav parity + limelight pill corner-hug + profile side-panel polish v2. Shipped to TestFlight 2026-05-23. iOS-only (Expo/React Native); no web code changed — tab structure mirrors web's existing 5-tab nav order, and the side-panel polish is a native-shell refinement on top of build-11. Recorded in `IOS_PARITY.md`.
  - **iOS (bottom tab bar restructured to web parity):** 5 tabs now in web-parity order — **Home · Academia · Learn · Compete · Social**. "Study" renamed to "Academia"; **Learn promoted from a pushed Stack screen to a top-level tab** (the 39KB Learn hub moved from `app/learn/index.tsx` → `app/(tabs)/learn.tsx`, with the `BackButton` stripped since tabs don't need it). **"You" dropped from the tab bar** — the file stays routable via `<Tabs.Screen name="profile" options={{ href: null }} />`, so `/profile` deep-links still work; the rich profile hub is now reached by **tapping the avatar in the profile side panel header** (distinct from the Edit Profile tile, which still opens the quick-edit form).
  - **iOS (active tab pill — tighter edge corners):** limelight pill height bumped **58 → 64** (smaller cream sliver top/bottom). On the leftmost/rightmost cell it gets a `translateX` nudge (**±3**) + a width grow (**+6**) so Home and Social hug the bar's rounded inner curve instead of floating mid-corner. Middle tabs unchanged.
  - **iOS (profile side panel polish v2):** options grid rebuilt as **5 circle-icon tiles** (icon-on-top, centered label below, no outer card background), fixed **84pt width** so the 2-2-1 arrangement aligns visually — Edit Profile · Settings / Notifications · Invite a Friend / Rate Lionade centered exactly under the seam of the rows above. Sign out swapped from a left-aligned row to a **centered red-outlined pill button**. Help & Support + Privacy & Terms moved to the **very bottom** under a hairline divider, just above the build footer.
  - **fix(ios): Go-Pro pill shape no longer "moves"** — the inner marquee gradient layer had its own `borderRadius: 999`, so its rounded left edge was visibly sliding through the pill window as the gradient translated (read as the "shape moving"). Inner radius removed; pill outer now enforces the silhouette via `overflow: hidden` + `borderRadius: 999` on the container, so only the colors flow.
- feat(ios-ui): iOS "build 11" profile-tab full settings hub + side-panel polish + onboarding-sync fix + small ergonomics. Shipped to TestFlight 2026-05-23. iOS-only (Expo/React Native); no web code changed — `/settings` web parity is mirrored inline in the iOS "You" tab (toggles share the same Supabase `user_preferences` row + AsyncStorage keys as `/settings`, so changes round-trip across screens), and the onboarding-sync fix only changes how iOS *reads* the existing web `profiles` row. Recorded in `IOS_PARITY.md`.
  - **iOS (Profile tab → full settings hub):** the "You" tab was rewritten into one long scrollable Apple-HIG inset-grouped page — hero + stat strip on top, then Lifetime / Recent Badges / Stats & Rankings / Account / Subscription / Appearance / Notifications / Privacy / Recent Activity / Support / About / Sign out + Delete account. Every section from `/settings` is mirrored inline; toggles share the same Supabase `user_preferences` row + AsyncStorage keys as `/settings` so changes round-trip across screens.
  - **iOS (profile side panel polish):** the Go-Pro card is now a fully-rounded pill with a 7s seamless marquee gradient (gold→purple→electric flowing left, palette repeats so the loop is invisible; respects reduce-motion). Account + More rows replaced by **5 shortcut tiles in a centered 2-2-1 grid** (Edit Profile · Settings / Notifications · Invite a Friend / Rate Lionade); Help & Support + Privacy & Terms are now small dim text links above Sign out. Panel right edge is curved (`borderTopRightRadius`/`borderBottomRightRadius: 48`, 1px border replaced with a right-edge shadow via a two-layer surface so iOS still draws the shadow under the clip).
  - **fix(ios): cross-platform onboarding-sync** — iOS auth gate (`lib/auth-context.tsx`) now also treats a profile as onboarded if `selected_subjects` or `education_level` is present (onboarding-only data, OAuth can't auto-derive), and self-heals by backfilling `onboarding_completed=true`. Web-onboarded accounts no longer get re-prompted on iOS; Apple/Google fresh signups still flow through onboarding correctly.
  - **iOS (Daily Fangs toast):** `components/ClockInToast.tsx` auto-dismiss reduced from 5s → **3s**.
  - **fix(ios): support email standardized** to `support@getlionade.com` everywhere (profile tab + `settings.tsx` previously used `support@lionade.com` — wrong domain bounces mail).
  - **iOS (app-icon variants):** Midnight / Wildfire / Platinum / Void now display **"SOON" tags + lock overlays + a "Coming Soon" alert on tap**, instead of pretending to apply — the variant artwork + native icon swap aren't shipped yet; this stops the misleading "Saved" alert on what's effectively the default icon.
- feat(ios-ui): iOS "build 10" profile-hub redesign + cross-platform avatar sync. Shipped to TestFlight 2026-05-22. iOS-only (Expo/React Native); no web-side code changed — the redesign is a native-shell enhancement with no web counterpart, and the avatar sync only changes how iOS *reads* the existing web avatar value. Recorded in `IOS_PARITY.md`.
  - **iOS (profile side panel → rich hub):** the build-9 left slide-in drawer is rebuilt into a full profile hub. Fixed the previously broken (label-less) rows. The avatar now has an animated **neon ring** — tier-colored, breathing, and skipped under reduce-motion — plus a tier badge and a **Fangs balance chip**. Adds a premium gradient **"Go Pro"** card (carrying a dormant PRO-member badge ready for when subscriptions are wired), a **2×3 shortcuts grid** (Shop, Wallet, Badges, Leaderboard, Games, Study DNA), an **Account** section (Edit Profile, Settings, Notifications), and a **More** section (Invite a Friend via the share sheet, Rate Lionade, Help & Support, Privacy & Terms). All routes verified.
  - **fix(ios): profile-picture sync (web ↔ iOS).** Web stores avatars as DiceBear **SVG** URLs, which React Native can't render — so iOS was falling back to initials. iOS now resolves avatars to **PNG** (rewriting DiceBear `/svg`→`/png`) and uses the same DiceBear default the web uses, so the **same profile picture renders on both platforms**. Applies to every avatar in the app; uploaded photos pass through unchanged.
- feat(ios-ui): iOS "build 9" native UI pass — edge-swipe-back, blurred bottom sheets, tappable dashboard stat orbs, and a profile side panel. Shipped to TestFlight 2026-05-22. iOS-only (Expo/React Native); no web-side code changed — these are native-shell enhancements with no web counterpart, recorded in `IOS_PARITY.md`.
  - **iOS (navigation Stack):** `fullScreenGestureEnabled` enabled so the iOS back-swipe works from anywhere across the screen, not just the ~20px left edge (it previously felt broken).
  - **iOS (shared `Sheet` component):** bottom sheets now blur the app behind them (`expo-blur`) instead of a flat black dim, with a hairline-bordered floating-card edge. The Quick Note capture sheet is capped below full-screen so it reads as a floating window, not a takeover.
  - **iOS (Study/Academia tab):** the "+ ADD" class button restyled into a bold gold oval with the `+` inside (it previously read faint).
  - **iOS (dashboard stat orbs):** all 5 dashboard orbs — Fangs, Streak, Level, Subjects, Rank — now open a blurred-backdrop detail window. Fangs (balance + View Wallet), Streak (current + best streak + next milestone + how-it-works), Level (XP-to-next + progress bar), Subjects (per-subject accuracy list), Rank (View Leaderboard).
  - **iOS (profile side panel):** tapping the dashboard top-left avatar opens a left slide-in drawer (blurred backdrop) with the user's avatar/name and quick links — Edit Profile, Settings, Notifications, Sign out.
- feat(academia): iOS Study/Academia tab now has a required onboarding gate at parity with web's `/academia/onboarding`, plus a gold "+ ADD" CTA. iOS-only build cycle (builds 6–8); web `/academia/onboarding` was already shipped, so this is a parity port — recorded in `IOS_PARITY.md`.
  - **iOS (`app/academia-onboarding.tsx`, NEW):** 5-step setup flow mirroring web — school type → class count → school name + grade/year → field of study → study intensity. The Study tab (`app/(tabs)/academia.tsx`) gates on it via a `useFocusEffect` that checks `/api/academia/onboarding` and redirects un-onboarded users; persists the same payload web sends (API parity verified). Gate **fails open** — no redirect loop, no crash — if the check errors.
  - **iOS (`app/(tabs)/academia.tsx`):** the faint header link is now a solid-gold pill matching the app's primary CTA styling; empty-state CTA + in-grid add tile unified into one gold family.
  - **fix(ios-build): production launch-crash fix** — missing `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` env vars now set in `eas.json` (the binary launched against an unconfigured Supabase client and crashed on boot). `expo-file-system` added as an explicit dependency.

## 2026-05-19
- feat(nav): sliding "limelight" bottom-nav highlight on web + iOS. Replaces the per-cell static gold pill with a single travelling backdrop that springs to the active tab.
  - **Web (`components/Navbar.tsx`):** framer-motion shared-layout — every bottom-nav `<Link>` conditionally renders a `motion.span layoutId="navLimelight"` backdrop + `layoutId="navLimelightBeam"` top beam only when active. Active state is pathname-driven (`isTabActive(item.href)`), so the DOM tree is invariant between SSR + first client render — no hydration risk. `useReducedMotion()` collapses to `{duration:0}`. Icon+label wrapped in a `<span className="relative z-10 flex flex-col items-center gap-0.5">` so the backdrop sits behind. Earlier session's `<Link><button>` → `<Link className>` hydration fix preserved.
  - **iOS (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`):** one `Animated.View` limelight pill, position driven by `useSharedValue` + `withSpring({stiffness:320, damping:30, mass:0.9})` against `state.index * cellW`. `cellW` measured via `onLayout` (idiomatic RN). Removed the per-cell static `backgroundColor: focused ? ACCENT_BG : "transparent"`. `useReducedMotion()` collapses to `withTiming(target,{duration:0})`. Haptics + `tabPress`/`defaultPrevented` guard + a11y (`selected: true`, `accessibilityRole/Label`) preserved.
  - **Tokens reused:** both platforms reuse the existing `ACCENT_BG` / `ACCENT_BORDER` rgba(255,215,0,…) — zero new design tokens.
- chore(build): `next.config.js` adds `resolve.extensionAlias = { ".js": [".ts",".tsx",".js"], ".mjs": [".mts",".mjs"], ".cjs": [".cts",".cjs"] }` so webpack resolves the `@lionade/core` shared TS package's NodeNext `.js` imports back to `.ts` source. Fixes `Module not found: Can't resolve './http.js'` 500s on every route.
- chore(ios-build): `package.json` adds `@react-native/virtualized-lists@0.81.5` as a top-level dep. RN 0.81.5 ships it as a transitive but `metro.config.js` sets `resolver.disableHierarchicalLookup = true` (workspace setup) and Metro can't resolve nested transitive deps — surfaced as a red-screen import error in `Libraries/Lists/SectionList.js`. Hoisting it explicitly is the standard RN fix.

## 2026-05-17
- feat(ui): new reusable Lionade-themed `ClaimBanner` component + applied to all 4 real claim surfaces, plus a Free→Pro upgrade nudge. Multi-concern frontend feature; routed `design-ui-ux` → `design-copywriter` → `dev-frontend` → `design-accessibility` → `quality-code-reviewer` → `quality-docs-writer`.
  - **New `components/ClaimBanner.tsx`** — one pure-presentational dismissible banner (no data/claim logic). Props: `variant` (gold/ember/electric/purple), `size` (pill/panel), `icon`, `eyebrow`, `title`, `description`, `meta`, `primaryAction` (href|onClick + disabled/loading), `secondaryAction`, `onDismiss`+`dismissLabel`, `children` slot, `role`, `ariaLabel`. framer-motion enter (`initial/animate` values) + restrained `whileHover/whileTap` micro-anim, `useReducedMotion()` honored. `cn` from `@/lib/utils`, phosphor `X` for dismiss. Lionade tokens only (gold #FFD700 / purple #7C3AED / electric #4A90D9 / ember #EF4444) — no boilerplate #005FF2. Hydration-safe: SSR element tree === first client render (no Math.random/Date/window/document at render; conditional sub-nodes branch on deterministic props only).
  - **Shell-only swap on 4 surfaces** (all claim logic/hooks/handlers/in-progress SWR changes preserved byte-for-byte — verified: zero +/- diff lines on any logic line): `components/DailyReadyNudge.tsx` (gold pill — only change: `setDismissed` moved inline-onClick→`onDismiss` prop, same handler), `components/StreakReviveBanner.tsx` (ember panel — `/api/streak-revive` SWR, `claim()` async, sessionStorage dismiss, `Countdown` helper, dual Fangs/$0.99 buttons via `children` slot all intact), `components/ClockInButton.tsx` (only the in-`HistoryPopover` "Ready now" claim block → gold pill; navbar `clock-in-btn`, `claim()`, `/api/login-bonus`, `HistoryPopover`/`ClockInReveal`, cooldown tile untouched), `components/DailyDrillWidget.tsx` (active "ready" prompt → electric panel inside the existing trigger `<button>`; completed branch + `DrillModal`/`submitFinalSelected`/`/complete` engine untouched).
  - **New `components/ProUpgradeNudge.tsx`** — Free→Pro nudge, single mount on `app/dashboard/page.tsx` in the existing nudge band (after `<StreakReviveBanner />`, before `<DailyDrillWidget />`). Plan detection via the canonical `usePlan()` (`@/lib/use-plan`, reads `profiles.plan`, fail-closed); renders ONLY for `plan === "free"` (hidden for paid, while loading, signed-out, or dismissed). CTA → `/pricing`. Copy facts from `lib/mastery-plan.ts`: 1.5× Fangs, 3 Mastery exams, no popup ads, $6.99/mo.
  - **a11y:** persistent nudges use `role="region"` (no re-announce), StreakRevive keeps `role="status"` (time-critical). Distinct dismiss `aria-label`s, no button-in-button, reduced-motion ✓. **Zero new deps** (no lucide-react; framer-motion-only; phosphor for X; package.json/lock untouched). `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `/dashboard` + `/pricing` serve 200. Nothing committed.
- perf(nav): migrate ~8 raw-fetch pages to the existing global persistent SWR cache so in-app navigation is instant instead of cold-refetch + empty flash. Web architecture/perf refactor — **data-fetch mechanism only**, zero UI/logic/copy change. Followed `dev-performance` audit (no re-audit); routed `dev-frontend` → `quality-qa-tester` → `quality-code-reviewer` → `quality-docs-writer`.
  - **Shared hooks:** added `useSubjectStats`, `useQuizHistory`, `useAllBadges`, `useUserBadges`, `useWeeklyLeaderboard`, `useEloLeaderboard` to `lib/hooks.ts` — thin SWR wrappers over the **unchanged** `lib/db.ts` functions, stable string keys mirroring the existing `user-stats/${userId}` convention, deduped app-wide via the global `<SWRConfig>` provider. Near-static data gets long `dedupingInterval` (badges 5min; leaderboards/user-badges 30–60s).
  - **P0 — raw fetch → SWR (no behavior change):** `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (14 uncached calls + the bespoke `lionade_dash_*` sessionStorage cache **deleted** — the global localStorage SWR provider supersedes it; optimistically-mutated state — userBounties/activeBet/dailyMissions — kept as `useState` hydrated via SWR `onSuccess` so claim/bet mutations survive revalidation; `/api/bounties/rotate` side-effect + chart-fill timing preserved). `app/learn/page.tsx` (shared `useQuizHistory(60)` + page-local missions key; heatmap/mastery `useMemo` deps untouched). `app/social/page.tsx` (the 5 manual `setInterval`s → SWR `refreshInterval` 10s/30s/60s/15s; `loadFriends/loadFeed/loadNudgeBudget/loadSocialNotifs/loadMessages` kept as `mutate`-backed revalidators so every imperative call site is unchanged; realtime/optimistic message state + unread side-effect preserved; pre-existing `cacheSocial` left intact — out of audit scope for social). `app/profile/page.tsx` (badges/stats bundle → shared hooks with the *lifetime* subject-stats variant + 30-row history; redundant `profiles select *` narrowed to the 4 columns the edit form actually consumes and SWR-cached — wholesale removal would have regressed the bio/education/goal prefill since those aren't on `useAuth().user`, so behaviour-preservation took precedence over the literal "delete it" directive; `username_changes` SWR-cached; background `refreshUser()` preserved). `app/badges/page.tsx`, `app/leaderboard/page.tsx` (filter behaviour + elo row normalization preserved exactly), `app/wallet/page.tsx`, `app/quiz/page.tsx` — all migrated to SWR with stable keys.
  - **P2 — internal `<a href>` → `next/link` `<Link>`** (kills full reloads): `app/leaderboard/page.tsx`, `app/profile/page.tsx` (Browse Themes → /shop), `app/compete/page.tsx` (Blitz card → /games), `app/page.tsx` (ENTER BETA → /home; added `next/link` import). In-page hash anchors (`app/page.tsx` `#how-it-works`, Navbar hash anchors) and the login `window.location.assign` workaround intentionally **left as-is**.
  - **P3 — quick wins:** `app/academia/page.tsx` onboarding-gate `useSWR` gained `keepPreviousData:true` (no loading-branch flash on re-entry); `components/Navbar.tsx` `avatarUrl` memoized with `useMemo` (mirrors `app/profile/page.tsx`) to keep `<img src>` referentially stable (no avatar hard-reload on tab return).
  - **Untouched (verified-correct infra, no churn):** `lib/swr-config.ts`, `components/SwrProvider.tsx`, `components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`, `lib/auth.tsx`, `components/PageTransition.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`. No new ad-hoc cache layers introduced — the global provider is the single cache. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; all scoped routes serve 200.
  - **iOS:** **no parity row** — this is a web-only data-fetch/architecture refactor with no user-facing feature surface; iOS SWR/data-cache layer was separately audited 2026-05-13 (`@lionade/core` hooks) and is already exemplary, so there is nothing to port and a row would be spurious. Reasoning recorded in `IOS_PARITY.md`.


## 2026-05-15
- feat(pricing): premium glassy redesign of revenue-critical `app/pricing/page.tsx` (visual shell only).
  - **Web:** deep glass plan cards (gradient ring on Pro = gold "Most Popular", silver/electric ring on Platinum), segmented monthly/annual toggle, large Bebas numerals, restored `#faq` deep-link anchor. New page-local `components/PricingShader.tsx` — raw WebGL (no new deps), Lionade-recolored (navy `#04080F` -> electric `#4A90D9` -> sparse gold `#FFD700`, no hue cycling), scoped to /pricing only (NOT in layout, does not alter global SpaceBackground elsewhere). Theme-detect via `html.light` (Lionade has no `.dark` class); `prefers-reduced-motion` skips WebGL/rAF entirely and renders a static Lionade gradient. Full GL/observer/rAF cleanup on unmount.
  - **Logic preserved:** all `PLAN_PRICING`/`PLAN_EXAM_LIMITS`/`PLAN_FANG_MULTIPLIER`/`PLAN_ADS` bindings, the cycle toggle, the annual `price/12` math, and every mailto upgrade CTA unchanged — no revenue regression. Fixed two pre-existing a11y defects (mislabeled CompareRow ad-row aria-labels; missing FAQ anchor).
  - **iOS:** pricing redesign NOT in this pass — tracked as pending follow-up in `IOS_PARITY.md`.
- feat(nav): consistent route-based "Back to {Parent}" affordance on every non-root screen, cross-platform.
  - **Web:** extended `components/BackButton.tsx` `PARENT_PATHS`/`PARENT_LABELS` + dynamic-route regexes for `/learn/mastery`, `/learn/mastery/[examId]`, `/classes`, `/classes/[id]`, `/study-dna`. Added/standardized `<BackButton/>` on `learn/mastery`, `learn/mastery/[examId]`, `classes`, `classes/[id]`, `study-dna` (replaced ad-hoc Phosphor breadcrumbs; fixed study-dna pointing at the wrong parent). Roots (`/academia`, `academia/onboarding` funnel) intentionally excluded.
  - **iOS:** new shared `components/BackButton.tsx` mirroring web's semantic-parent behavior (NOT history). Applied to all 21 pushed/non-tab screens, replacing ~21 inconsistent ad-hoc disc/chevron back controls (3 local `BackButton` copies + `BackChip` deleted). Tab screens unchanged; native swipe-back preserved. `edit-profile` keeps its unsaved-changes discard guard; `arena`/`duel`/`quiz` in-match abandon controls left intact.
  - iOS parity tracked in `IOS_PARITY.md`.
